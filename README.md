# PyPSA-Eur-IAM: Coupling PyPSA-Eur with Integrated Assessment Models

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a fork of [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) maintained by the 
> [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de).
> It extends PyPSA-Eur with modifications required to couple it with Integrated Assessment
> Models (IAMs) such as [REMIND](https://github.com/remindmodel/remind).

## What's different from upstream PyPSA-Eur

This fork tracks upstream PyPSA-Eur releases.

- **IAM coupling interface:** scripts and rules to exchange data with IAMs such as REMIND, using the [IAM-PyPSA-coupling](https://github.com/pik-piam/iam-pypsa-coupling) package
- **Simplified sector coupling:** REMIND's sectoral electricity demand (`electrolysis`, `EV_pass`, `EV_freight`, `heatpump`, `resistive`) is attached to the network as simplified per-sector bus/link/load structures — an electricity-consuming link per sector feeding a load sized from REMIND's demand, rather than the full technology detail of upstream PyPSA-Eur's own sector-coupling model. See the [Sector Coupling](https://pik-piam.github.io/IAM-PyPSA-coupling/getting-started/sector-coupling/) page of the IAM-PyPSA-coupling docs.

Changes are kept as minimal and non-invasive as possible to simplify syncing with future upstream releases.

## Workflow

The diagram below is the Snakemake job graph (`--dag`) for solving one REMIND-coupled network. Rules defined in `rules/REMIND_coupling.smk` — where REMIND's output file (`REMIND2PyPSAEUR.gdx` or a `.mif`) enters the workflow and is turned into demand, capacities, CO2 prices and costs — are highlighted in orange; everything else in grey is the standard PyPSA-Eur data-retrieval and network-building pipeline that these rules feed into via `add_electricity_sector_REMIND`.

<sub>Regenerate with (note: the target must come before `--configfile` on the command line; substitute a scenario/iteration for which the REMIND input file already exists under `resources/`):
`snakemake -s Snakefile_REMIND "results/SCENARIO/iITER/yYEAR/networks/base_s_4_elec_.nc" --configfile config/config.remind_de.yaml --dag > doc/img/dag.dot && python doc/highlight_remind_dag.py doc/img/dag.dot doc/img/dag_remind_2050.png`</sub>

## Syncing with upstream

This fork is periodically synced with upstream PyPSA-Eur releases, currently `v2026.02.0`. Also see tag [`v2026.02.0-iam-sync`](https://github.com/pik-piam/pypsa-eur-iam/releases/tag/v2026.02.0-iam-sync).

## Getting started

See the [upstream PyPSA-Eur documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io) for general PyPSA-Eur usage. For IAM-specific functionality — what data is exchanged, how the coupling package works, technology mapping, downscaling, capacity harmonisation, sector coupling — see the [IAM-PyPSA-coupling Getting Started guide](https://pik-piam.github.io/IAM-PyPSA-coupling/getting-started/).

For this repo specifically, see the following key files:

- `Snakefile_REMIND`: Main snakemake file for the coupling with IAMs, currently configured for REMIND.
  - Includes new wildcards for `iter_REMIND` (only used for bidirectional coupling) and `year_REMIND` for REMIND timesteps 
- `REMIND_coupling.smk`: Contains all new rules required for the coupling, in particular:
  - `import_REMIND_demand`: Importing electricity demand from REMIND
  - `downscale_REMIND_demand`: Downscaling electricity demand from REMIND regions to country level
  - `import_REMIND_capacities`: Importing power plant capacities from REMIND (optionally enforced per region in `installed_capacity_constraints_REMIND.py`)
  - `import_REMIND_co2price`: Importing CO2 price pathway from REMIND per region
  - `import_REMIND_costs`: Importing all required techno-economic parameters from REMIND. Note that costs are different across REMIND regions (PyPSA-Eur default is uniform costs across Europe)
  - `import_REMIND_hydro`: Special case for importing hydropower from REMIND. Current implementation adjusts PyPSA-Eur's inflow time series to match REMIND's capacity factor.
  - `adjust_powerplants_REMIND`: Adjusting PyPSA-Eur's power plant matching database to be consistent with REMIND's capacities. See file for further information.
  - `add_electricity_sector_REMIND`: Main file that builds the full network. Based on `add_electricity`, but includes additional sectoral demand profiles.
  - `prepare_network_REMIND`: Same as `prepare_network` with additional wildcards.
  - `solve_network_REMIND`: Same as `solve_network` with additional wildcards and using an optional SSH tunnel for Gurobi license verification if run on PIK HPC.
  - `export_to_REMIND`: Currently not in use!
- `config/config.remind.yaml`: Config file for REMIND coupling
- `config/technology_mapping_REMIND.yaml`: Per-technology parameter mapping file (IAM/PyPSA/fixed) for costs and capacities from canonical technology output of IAM-PyPSA-coupling package.
- `config/regionmapping_21_EU11.csv`: Region mapping file from REMIND to ISO.
- `scripts/remind`: All scripts for the new rules.
